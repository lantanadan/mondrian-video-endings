Mondrian Video Endings
----------------------
I present to you these endtitle videos, free of charge OR license, to optionally use with your Mondrian - Plastic Reality videos, be they gameplay, speedpaints, tutorials, or anything in between.
These videos come in two varieties:

<br><b>Vertical:</b> Available in MP4 and MOV format. Use this one for vertical videos to be viewed on mainly mobile devices. Suggested platforms include YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok.
![mpr_shortsEnding_widscreen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54c8ba73-ed11-44f4-b136-93dc3b91f695)
<br><b>Widescreen:</b> Available in MP4 and MOV format. Use this one for widescreen videos to be viewed mainly on desktop monitors, laptops, or TV's. Suggested platforms include YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.

Like I said, these are optional, but using them can help other players find the game and your creations! Feel free to add your own music, voiceover, or sound effects, and also add in links to store pages or our socials, <b>@lantanagames</b>, if you feel so inclined.
